    <h2>Multiple languages</h2>
    <p>Modo Quiz doesn't limit you with one language - while
        <a href="login.htm">signing up</a> to Modo Quiz, you can select a comfortable language from the list. Or do it later on the SETTINGS
        page</p>

    <h2>Play One On One or with multiple players</h2>
    <p>There are two quiz modes available in Modo Quiz:
        <a href="play-friend.htm">ONE ON ONE</a> and
        <a href="play-friends.htm">CHALLENGE</a>. </p>

    <p>In the ONE ON ONE mode, you will compete with a single opponent for 3 rounds, 6 questions each.</p>
    <p>In the CHALLENGE mode, any number of players can join a challenge, if you invite them to take part in a quiz. There are
        no rounds in this mode: players answer all questions in one go.</p>

    <h2>Facebook integration, quiz sharing, making friends</h2>
    <p>Modo Quiz allows and encourages you to

        <a href="add-friends.htm">add friends</a> both within the game, if you know the username of a person, or invite friends from Facebook. The
        more you share and make friends the more

        <a href="custom.htm">create your own topics and questions</a> via the Modo Quiz Admin Panel. Be original!</p>
