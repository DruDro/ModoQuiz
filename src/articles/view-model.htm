    <p>The Model View ViewModel pattern separates the concerns of the following questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Model</b>: How do we get the data we need?
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>View</b>: How do we show the data to the user?
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>ViewModel</b>: What data should we show to the user?
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>TBy using this pattern; implementation, maintenance and implementation benefits. Each part of the system has a clear
        responsibility and a clear and loose coupling to the other parts of the system. Bugs are easily located (i.e. if
        something is displayed wrong, it’s in the View, if some data is wrong it’s in the Model and if some data is missing
        from the View it’s the ViewModel).
    </p>
