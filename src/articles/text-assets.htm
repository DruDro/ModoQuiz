    <div class="abstract">Modo Quiz is a multilingual app, as such all text will be read from a  well-defined resource </div>
    <p>We will store all text strings in a file that is easily editable by any text editor. We propose the
        following  format, stored in a simple .txt file:  </p>
    <span>>_/ norwegian.txt</span>
    <pre><code>    play   = Spill
    buy    = Kj&Oslash;p</code></pre>
    <p>Each language will therefore have an associated resource file, which associates a system key (for instance
         play) to the actual display text ("Spill").
    </p>
    <p>These files will need to be stored using the <b>Unicode</b> encoding to ensure correct representation of special
         characters (such as &#198;, &Oslash; and &#197;).
