    <p>Every badge brings you some Modo Coins.</p>
    <p>Modo Coins allow you use aids in a quiz.</p>
    <p>As described in the
        <a href="play.htm">How to Play</a> article, there are 4 aids to help you win the quiz:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>50/50</b> - When this option is selected, 50% of the wrong answers are removed </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>More time</b> - When this option is selected, the countdown timer adds 15 seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Hint</b> - When this option is selected a text hint is given to the player. This hint is relevant to the
                question to make it easier to answer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Skip</b> - When this option is selected, the player skips the current question with no loss in score.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You spend a coin every time you use an aid. So, to be undefeatable in any quiz, you can renew the chest of coins in the
        <b>Modoshop</b>
