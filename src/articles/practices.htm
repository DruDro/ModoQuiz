    <p>The Modo Quiz project will be managed as a
        <b>Lean</b> project with a
        <b>Kanban</b> board for action points and
        <b>User  Stories</b>.  </p>
    <p>We will strive to have a buildable product within the two first weeks of development. Having a buildable
         product means that it is possible to iterate with feedback from Product Owner, on the topics that
        needs  discussion in order to secure progress.
