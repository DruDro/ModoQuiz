<div class="article__content">
    <div class="abstract">Even though there is little interaction design presented, Pixelware will employ experience and create a vivid and exciting
        experience for the user.
        <br>
        <b>No action should go unnoticed, no reward should pass unseen. </b> </div>
    <p>The design outlined in the aforementioned design resource <sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> does not include any interaction design, nor any animations
        and transitions. Based on Pixelware’s experience with interaction design and games specifically – we will make opinionated
        suggestions for review. One of the iteration builds will be focused on interaction design feedback, and at this point
        we can change animations and transitions to match the expectations of Product Owner. Changes in this subject are
        a timely and costly affair, so we will limit the iterations focused on interaction design to two iterations. Which
        will result in at most three different designs (our original, revision 1, revision 2) after this an agreement should
        be made between Pixelware and Product Owner to come to a decision in regards to interaction design, animations and
        transitions. </p>
    <h2>Animations</h2>
    <p>The login screen has an animated logo. We will split the layers of the circular logo and make them rotate in alternating
        directions (so they align once every spin).
    </p>
    <p>This iconic animation will be repeated as a visual hook for the user to indicate that the game is doing something. This
        may include retrieving the next question, waiting for payment acceptance etc. </p>
    <p>Animations will be made in a reusable fashion, so we can apply any given animation (for instance a shrink, grow, spin
        etc) to any given visual component. </p>
    <h2>Sscreen Transitions</h2>
    <p>We will make a smooth and natural transition between screens. This is an animation that will be repeated across all screens,
        so it should be fast, fluid and natural. </p>
    <p>There are many sources of inspiration for this, and we will make something that feels good, but maybe also adds a bit
        flare to the Modo Quiz Game. A subtle change that will differentiate this fun app from the rest.
    </p>
    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>Every click (on a clickable icon or button) should invoke an animation of either size, color or font changes.
    </p>
    <p>This animation will be reused across most graphics that can be clicked; so it should be fast, fluid and natural.
    </p>
    <p>Some buttons will most likely have a special and more exciting animation, such as when using a Modo Quiz, and selecting
        an Answer from a Question.
    </p>
