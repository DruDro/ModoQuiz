<div class="article__content">
    <p>The Modo Quiz delivery will contain a simple, yet functional and powerful, backend where players can contribute new Questions
        for the game to use.
    </p>
    <p>Modo Quiz Backend version 1 (which will be delivered as part of this project) will allow a Modo Quiz registered user
        to log in to a contributor site; and contribute a Question. This will be done using a form with an interface that
        should feel familiar to the user (every aspect of the Question Domain Model will be editable by creator, except for
        internal system IDs). If no design is provided for this, Pixelware will employ a modified version of the industry
        standard CSS template called
        <b>Bootstrap</b>
        with a modified color palette to match the Modo Quiz Game. If a design is provided, Pixelware will need to have some say
        into what can and cannot be done within the timeline of this project.
    </p>
    <p>When a Question is contributed, an admin will then have to certify that the question is (at the very least): </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not offensive
            <sup>
                <a href="#4">4</a>
            </sup>
        </li>

        <li>Correct</li>

        <li>Classified correctly (with category and topic) </li>


    </ul>
    <p>The creator and the admin will both get a list of close matches in order to warn about possible duplicates. The administrator
        can change any part of the question. Upon certification, the contributor and the admin will be associated to the
        Question. </p>
