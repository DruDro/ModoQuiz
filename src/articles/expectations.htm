    <div class="abstract">Pixelware will provide the Product owner with regular builds and feedback should be on-point. </div>
    <p>When early builds are made available, for review by the Product Owner, Pixelware will indicate what aspects
         is a matter of discussion. The early builds will not be fully functional or completely designed.
        In order for  rapid iterations to be productive the Product Owner will need to keep the feedback
        scoped to the build that  is presented (i.e. a build that shows the start screen animation feature
        should not get feedback about the  login button not being clickable).  </p>
    <p>A build will come with a set of bullet points that is a complete set of features or design that is
        subject for  discussion. As we close in on the final build, this list will be removed and at this
        point any and all feedback is  welcome. If ideas are presented that is not a part of the specification,
        they will receive an estimate (both  production time and price) and Product Owner can choose to add
        the feature to the delivery at an agreed  upon price.
