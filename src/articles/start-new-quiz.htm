    <p>From the home screen, if “Start New Quiz" is clicked, we’ll go to this screen. The Start New Quiz screen has four options:
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge A Friend</h2>
    <p>One-on‐one challenge. Follows the Quiz Sequence.
    </p>
    <h2>Random Challenge</h2>
    <p>In this mode, the system will try to match you with another player who has also clicked 'random challenger'. We will
        set a configurable timeout for this, as a way to tell the user "there is currently no one looking to play against
        a random challenger". </p>
    <h2>Challenge Friends</h2>
    <p>Multiple friends can take the same challenge (either found through a text code on Facebook wall, or as an in-app challenge
        to a friend you already know). Follows the Challenge Quiz Sequence.
    </p>
    <h2>Join Challenge</h2>
    <p>This enables you to search for a challenge with an identifier as seen on a friend's Facebook wall. The identifiers should
        be short and memorable. For example "Challenge by Eirik Påske 2015" where the text in italics is user defined upon
        Challenge Quiz creation. </p>
