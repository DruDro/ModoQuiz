    <div class="abstract">Modifications of the game flow - many against many - Friends against friends. </div>
    <p>When a Game Domain Object has more than one Challengee then that game is considered a Challenge Quiz.
    </p>
    <p>A challenge quiz should be postable to the user's Facebook wall. This will create an entry on the wall with the identifying
        name for the quiz. Other friends who join through Facebook will then have to open the app, and search up a challenge
        quiz. The user will then use the Join Challenge option in the "Choose your game" screen from the design resource.
        </p>
    <p>The only differences from a regular Quiz flow is:
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge Quiz Sequence</h2>
    <p>In a challenge quiz, there is only one phase. This means that every user answers all the questions in one go. There is
        no sync time to wait for the other users to finish.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge Score Board</h2>
    <p>Challenge Quiz will show a High Score List (in accordance with the design resource) instead of the classic Scoreboard.
        When clicking of an entry in the High Score List a Scoreboard will be shown between yourself and the person that
        was clicked.
    </p>
    <p>In the list, the entry for You is highlighted, but it cannot be clicked.
    </p>
