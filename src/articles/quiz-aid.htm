    <p>Quiz aid is in-game help that makes it easier for the player to select the correct answer. These quiz aid are small
        icons that are clickable when the player is answering quiz questions. There are three quiz aid alternatives selectable
        from the quiz game page:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>50/50</b>
            - When this option is selected, 50% of the wrong answers are removed (made inactive)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>More time
            </b>
            - When this option is selected, the countdown timer adds 15 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Hint</b>
            - When this option is selected a text hint is given to the player. This hint is relevant to the question to make it easier
            to answer.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Quiz aids will be acquired when pressed, and the account will withdraw coins at this point. As such, aids are only clickable
        when the user has Coins. If the user clicked an aid (in an attempt to buy it) but had insufficient coins, the store
        will open at the first available time (after timer is out) with an explanation that itâ€™s opened because the player
        needs more coins in order to complete the intent to get an Aid.
    </p>
    <p>If coins are available, then the Aid icon will play an animation and take effect, then it is set to not-clickable state
        (grayed out, or transparency).
    </p>
