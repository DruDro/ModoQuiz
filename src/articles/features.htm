    <h2>General Info</h2>
    <h2>1</h2>[Client side] Description
    <br> On the app UI we will see the Custom Quiz / [Username's Quiz] / Kristian's Quiz as one more carousel item.
    <br> Then different categories of this user's questions can be presented to user as sub-categories (list) under Custom Quiz
    category.
    <br> Questions of user, eventually, will be presented there under each sub-category.
    <br> Feature turn-on
    <br> User should be able to activate via a code / qr code.
    <br> [Back-end]
    <br> We should have ability to manage the Quiz on a separate web page only. On this page we will have one page for each new
    quiz added and then 1 page for questions pr quiz.
    <br> 1) Admins can manage both - questions from preset categories as well as customers' questions.
    <br> 2) Users/customers can manage only their own questions. End users just log into their own profile (web page), and Create
    Quiz > add questions.
    <br> Let's have it working this way:
    <br> If there is less than 6 custom questions added by user to the "Cutsom" category, we should add rest of the questions
    by the similar approach we use in the "Random Challenge".
    <br> Example: If user added only 4 questions, the rest 2 questions will be taken by the app randomly from the existing questions
    database.
    <h2>2 ui</h2>
    For different background colors of questions, we should make some logic which will change the color of question font to be
    more readable.
    <br> So, that on Yellow or light-red, -orange, or any other lighter backgrounds we use the "black" color (check the exact
    color-code in the app) of the app.
    <br> While on the darker backgrounds we should keep using the white color for the purpose.
    <h2>3</h2> Make the posting to a wall in Facebook able to tag only specific friends Share to FB friend should make it visible
    only to a friend and not to "All Friends".
    <h2>4</h2>
    [Random challenge] If there are not users to play with, show a message
    <br> Random challenge: If there are no users to play with, have a message in footer after searching for opponent text: "No
    active opponent right now!"
    <h2>5</h2>
    Correct wordings of Push messages and add new if they are absent
    <br>1. Game start: XXX wants to challenge you in ModoQuiz right now (is sent right after user was added/invited to the game).
    <br> 2. Your turn: It's your turn in ModoQuiz
    <br> 3. Result: Get the result of your ModoQuiz game with XXX
    <h2>6</h2>
    Store a collection of tokens for push notfications to be sent to all devices
    <p>In order to notify ALL devices by push notification in case user used same account from different devices, we need to
        improve the tokens storage and keep a collection of them instead of a single one like it is right now.</p>
    <h2>7</h2>
    under friends and also under choose an opponent via Facebook - search function
    <p>As explained above. here is a
        <a href="https://monosnap.com/file/tlAOCggkSve0BbhdIG82716Fm0LoYO">screenshot explaining</a>
    </p>
    <p>This works well. Just one small thing. When I open app I start in friends section with Facebook/invite section. it should
        be on friends as main.. and people can choose to go to invite. OK?</p>
    <h2>8</h2>
    admin interface
    <br>
    <p>Customer has asked for a place, where they can change certain parameters of the game. We can expand on this in future.
        But initially, customer (NOT user) should be able to set:</p>
    Initial coins a user will have when setting up a new account
    <br> How many coins used for each option (i.e. Hint, 50/50, etc.)
    <br> How many seconds for each question. Is this a large job? I guess today it is almost hard coded.. but, we need to make
    it admin friendly.
    <br> I need someone to tell me amount of work that will go into this please.
    <p>I like mockups. I have small detail for text. also, lets make it so it is easy for you to change text if needed...
        <br> https://monosnap.com/file/rGOoiW2UI6UaZC9idL7Q08VhjTJ0mE
        <br> I have added one more question in this. which I forgot from before. This is if price can be set from here in app
        store and google play.. Or is this hard? and must be done in the stores?</p>
    <h2>9</h2>
    Add the "Progress wheel" animation when action takes time
    <p>"i tested the invite feature. one thing, perhaps it is Facebook, but once I click it takes a few seconds to understand
        that something is happening…and I held the invite button for a while… so my daughter got three invites."" So, please
        add the progress wheel over the semi-transparent background over the screen. Also make sure repeated touches are
        not applied until the first one request completes.</p>
    <h2>10</h2>
    [FB] Taggable friends notification in Facebook
    <br> It appears as she has been tagged with the text we wrote. I think it would be better if it when too her only… not so
    all friends can see also.. People dont love to be tagged for all friends to see. if it is possible to just alert that
    user, this is better.. can you check?
    <br> To restrict certain user groups we need to use FbUI, but FbUI hsn't ability to tag anyone. So it can't be used for taggableFriends
    and for invitation to install the game. We can do such operations for friends who already installed the app
    <br> Jan Christian replied: Tet's leave as is.
    <br> A question from Jan C: Can we tag on in future link to I.e App Store?
    <br> Roman: you mean to have there different link, like a direct URL to the App Store market with this app?
    <br> [4:52:35 PM] Jan Christian Berger: Yes
    <br> Alexander Kodenko added a comment - 23/Oct/15 6:15 PM we can add any link to post
    <h2>11</h2>
