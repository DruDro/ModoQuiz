    <h2>Quiz Mode</h2>
    <p>From the home screen, if "Start New Quiz" is tapped, we&apos;ll go to this screen. The CHOOSE YOUR GAME screen has three options:

    </p>
    <a name="friend"></a>
    <h3>Challenge A Friend</h3>
    <p>One on one challenge. There are 3 rounds of the quiz. 6 questions in each round. When a round is complete, the player
        who initiated the challenge has to wait until the opponent completes the round.
    </p>
    <p>See the
        <a href="play-friend.htm">Challenge a Friend</a> article for more details.</p>
    <a name="random"></a>
    <h3>Random Challenge</h3>
    <p>In this mode, the system will try to match you with another player who has also tapped 'random challenge'. </p>
    <p>This is a one on one quiz. </p>
    <a name="friends"></a>
    <h3>Challenge Friends</h3>
    <p>Multiple friends can take the same challenge (either found through a text code on Facebook wall, or as an in-app challenge
        to a friend you already know).
    </p>
    <p>In a challenge quiz, there is only one phase. This means that every user answers all the questions in one go. There is
        no sync time to wait for the other users to finish.</p>

    <p>See the
        <a href="play-friends.htm">Challenge Friends</a> article for more details.</p>
    <a name="join"></a>
    <h3>Join a Challenge</h3>
    <p>Otherwize, if you tap
        <b>JOIN CHALLENGE</b> on the Home screen, you will get to the CHALLENGE screen.</p>
    <p>This enables you to search for a challenge with an identifier as seen on a friend's Facebook wall. The identifiers should
        be short and memorable. For example "Challenge by Eirik P&#197;ske 2015" where the text in italics is user defined upon

    <h2>Quiz Gameplay</h2>
    <p>So there are 2 types of quiz:
        <i>
            <b>one-on-one</b>
        </i> and
        <i>
            <b>challenge</b>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>The main difference is that in the one-on-one mode there are rounds by 6 questions, and in the challenge mode - you answer
        all questions in one go.</p>

    </p>
    <p>In any quiz mode, you can use "aids", such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>50/50</b> - When this option is selected, 50% of the wrong answers are removed </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>More time</b> - When this option is selected, the countdown timer adds 15 seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Hint</b> - When this option is selected a text hint is given to the player. This hint is relevant to the
                question to make it easier to answer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Skip</b> - When this option is selected, the player skips the current question with no loss in score.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
